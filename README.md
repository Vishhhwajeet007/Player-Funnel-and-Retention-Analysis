# Player-Funnel-and-Retention-Analysis
Project Overview

# This project analyzes player behavior in an online gaming/betting dataset to identify:

- Conversion funnel drop-offs from registration to first activity

- Retention & engagement patterns in the first 30 days

- Player segmentation based on deposits and profitability

- The goal was to provide data-driven insights that can improve onboarding, retention, and revenue strategies.

# ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- PostgreSQL â†’ Data cleaning, SQL queries, exploratory data analysis

- Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy) â†’ Data manipulation & preprocessing

- Power BI â†’ Dashboards & advanced data visualization

# ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used

- Player details

- First deposit data

- First bet data

- Player activity logs

- Bonus cost data

# ðŸ“Š Key Analyses
## 1. Funnel & Conversion

- Funnel Stages: Registration â†’ First Deposit â†’ First Bet â†’ Active in 30 days

- Findings:

 - 43% conversion from registration to deposit â†’ main drop-off point

 - 81% conversion from deposit to first bet â†’ strong intent among depositors

 - 91% bet within 30 days â†’ high short-term engagement

## Insight: Improving onboarding incentives could significantly reduce the early drop-off.

## 2. Retention & Engagement

- Cohorted players by days active in the first 30 days (0â€“7, 8â€“15, etc.)

- Deposits proportional across cohorts â†’ no single group over-contributing

- 90% players placed first bet on the same day as deposit â†’ strong intent

## Engagement Insight: Short deposit-to-bet gaps indicate higher lifetime value.

## 3. Player Segmentation

- Top 10% players contributed ~49% of deposits â†’ strong concentration of revenue.

- Deposit buckets show clustering:

- 0â€“100 deposits dominate in count (98k players)

- 101â€“500 deposits dominate in value

## Insight: Low depositors bring volume, but mid-level depositors drive revenue.

# ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Business Impact

- Major drop-off at deposit stage â†’ need stronger incentives, trust-building.

- Retention closely tied to fast engagement â†’ players who bet right after deposit are most valuable.

- Revenue concentration â†’ top 10% of players drive half the deposits.

- First deposit amount is not a perfect profitability predictor â†’ volume matters more.
